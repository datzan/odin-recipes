    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We all need a basic pancake recipe that is your lazy Sunday go-to breakfast when you are just craving fluffy pancakes. Something easy and quick to make. With a long week behind me, I often happen to be tired, and for these lazy mornings, this easy breakfast recipe is just perfect.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Melted butter (or vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk the wet ingredients in a separate bowl, then add the dry ingredients to the wet ones and mix and stir until just combined (do not overmix). My secret: let the batter sit for a minute or two. It will allow the baking powder to activate and make your pancakes fluffy.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or butter in a skillet or griddle and once hot, drop two or three Tablespoons of the batter for each pancake, making sure the pancakes do not spread out. Cook for a minute, until fluffy. Flip, and cook on the other side for another minute. And voil√†! Here to some perfect fluffy pancakes in NO TIME!</li>
    </ol>
