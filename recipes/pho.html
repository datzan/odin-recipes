    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Vietnamese Phó, traditionally served with beef, is a national treasure. Actually it's the national dish of Vietnam. Don't quote me on that though.</p>
    <p>The broth is very hearthy, fresh and full of flavours. Combine that with the fresh herbs, fresh cut meat and rice noodles and you have a tradional Phó. Eat it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Phó does not discriminate.</p>
